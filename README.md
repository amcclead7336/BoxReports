# BoxReports
## Whoami
Hello and welcome to my box reports. I’m an up and coming cyber security professional currently training on Capture the Flag (CTF) boxes. The boxes are representations of actual machines professionals may find in the field. The hosting of the machines are provided by companies for the express purpose of being tested and broken into. 

Not only am I testing my skill at breaking into these boxes, but I’m also working on my skills in reporting on how I broke into them. Being able to document how you broke into something helps others understand how to secure and protect it better.
